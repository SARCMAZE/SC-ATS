# SC-ATS

🚀 Cloud-Based ATS Resume Analyzer
📌 Project Overview

The Cloud-Based ATS Resume Analyzer is an enterprise-inspired, cloud-native resume screening platform that replicates how modern organizations automate their initial hiring process.

The system intelligently evaluates resumes against multiple job roles, generates an ATS score, shortlists qualified candidates, and seamlessly integrates with a simulated cloud workflow for document handling. The project demonstrates end-to-end system design, serverless computing, and real-world hiring automation practices.

This project reflects the architecture and behavior of production-grade Applicant Tracking Systems used by large tech companies.

✨ Key Features

🔍 Automated ATS-based resume screening

🎯 Role-specific resume evaluation

📊 Intelligent ATS score generation (0–100)

✅ Automated shortlisting logic

☁️ Cloud-based serverless backend

📁 Secure document upload workflow

⚡ Real-time frontend–backend communication

🔐 Enterprise-grade API design

📈 Scalable, modular architecture

🧠 Intelligent ATS Engine

The ATS engine is designed to evaluate resumes using:
